description: "Mark Twain's (Burlesque) Autobiography and First Romance is an 1871\
  \ book by American author Mark Twain. Published by Sheldon & Co. in 1871, the book\
  \ consists of two short stories: \"A Burlesque Autobiography\", which first appeared\
  \ in Twain's Memoranda contributions to The Galaxy, and \"First Romance\", which\
  \ originally appeared in The Express in 1870.\nThe book bears no relationship to\
  \ Twain's actual life. The two short stories present fictional characters who are\
  \ supposedly part of Twain's lineage. In the final passage, Twain develops the story\
  \ to a point of crisis, and then abruptly ends the tale, saying:\nWith that, Twain's\
  \ \"Autobiography\" ends.\nThe illustrations form an interesting aspect of this\
  \ book. They have no relationship to the text of the book. Rather, they use cartoons\
  \ illustrating the children's poem The House that Jack Built to lampoon the Erie\
  \ Railroad Ring (the house) and its participants, Jay Gould, John T. Hoffman, and\
  \ Jim Fisk.\nThe book was not one of Twain's personal favorites. Two years after\
  \ publication, he bought all of the printing plates of the book and destroyed them.\n\
